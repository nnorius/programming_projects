Space Race

- This project was implemented with Monogame and Bepu Physics Engine V1
- use keys A D W S to apply an angular impulse to the ship and steer Left, Right, Up, Down
- use Space to give gas by adding a linear impulse to go forward
- The hoop that is lit up is the next one, and to not be penalized you must go through them in order
- Each time a hoop is missed it adds 1 minute to your time (final score)
- Time starts when you go forward with your ship
- the last hoop is the finish line, so time stops after you go through it
